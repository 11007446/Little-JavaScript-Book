## Motivation

As much as I love "You don't know JS" and "Eloquent JavaScript" I feel there is the need for a book which takes the reader by hand. Also, everyone has a unique viewpoint on technical topics and my readers love my style of teaching. The "Little JavaScript Book" aims to be a reference on the hard parts of JavaScript aiming at beginners but also at more experienced developers.

## What's in the book?

The "Little JavaScript Book" is organized in three parts. The first part covers the inner working of JavaScript engines and the "hard parts" of the language: closures, the prototype system, this and new. Every chapter ends with a self-assessment test which is useful for making the concepts stick.

The second part of the book has a lot of practical exercises with the DOM and a lot of pages covering code organization and best practices. The third and last part contains solutions for the exercises and future additions to the book.

## What's the difference between free and paid copy of the book?

The [paid](https://leanpub.com/little-javascript/) version has:
 
- **more quizzes** at the end of every chapter
- **solutions for the exercises**
- a lot of **tips and best practices**
- bonus chapter
